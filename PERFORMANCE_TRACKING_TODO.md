# Performance Tracking System - Setup TODO

## üéØ Status: Ready for Database Setup

All performance tracking files have been deployed to production. The system is ready to start collecting comprehensive data on every question attempt.

## ‚úÖ What's Been Completed:

### **Files Deployed to Production**:
- `database_setup.sql` - Complete MySQL schema with 3 tables + 2 views
- `api/config.php` - Database configuration (needs credentials updated)
- `api/record_attempt.php` - API endpoint to record question attempts
- `api/get_performance_data.php` - API endpoint to retrieve performance data
- `js/performanceTracker.js` - JavaScript performance tracking module
- `js/game.js` - Updated with integrated performance tracking
- `admin.html` - Professional performance dashboard
- `test_db.php` - Database connection test utility
- `DATABASE_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Complete setup instructions

### **System Features**:
- ‚úÖ Records every single question attempt with timing data
- ‚úÖ Response time tracking to nearest 100ms (if under 10 seconds)
- ‚úÖ Session-based grouping (20 questions per session)
- ‚úÖ User performance summaries and statistics
- ‚úÖ Professional admin dashboard with filtering and CSV export
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation and setup guides

### **Version Control**:
- ‚úÖ All changes committed to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Latest commit: `ddac10e` - "Implement comprehensive MySQL performance tracking system"
- ‚úÖ Repository: https://github.com/patrickmagee/rewardmaths.git

## üîß **NEXT STEPS TO COMPLETE:**

### **Step 1: Create MySQL Database** (5 minutes)
**Location**: Bluehost cPanel ‚Üí MySQL Databases

1. **Create Database**:
   - Database Name: `rewardmaths_performance`
   - Click "Create Database"

2. **Create User**:
   - Username: `rewardmaths_user`
   - Password: Generate strong password (save it!)
   - Click "Create User"

3. **Grant Privileges**:
   - Add user to database
   - Grant "ALL PRIVILEGES"
   - Click "Make Changes"

### **Step 2: Update Database Credentials** (2 minutes)
**File**: https://rewardmaths.com/api/config.php

Update these lines with your actual credentials:
```php
define('DB_NAME', 'your_cpanel_username_rewardmaths_performance');
define('DB_USER', 'your_cpanel_username_rewardmaths_user');
define('DB_PASS', 'your_actual_password');
```

**Note**: Bluehost prefixes database/user names with your cPanel username.

### **Step 3: Create Database Tables** (2 minutes)
**Location**: cPanel ‚Üí phpMyAdmin

1. Select your new database
2. Click "SQL" tab
3. Copy entire contents of `database_setup.sql`
4. Paste into SQL box
5. Click "Go" to execute

### **Step 4: Test the System** (3 minutes)

1. **Test Database Connection**:
   - Visit: https://rewardmaths.com/test_db.php
   - Should show "‚úÖ Database connection successful!"
   - Should list all created tables

2. **Test Game Integration**:
   - Play game at: https://rewardmaths.com/index.html
   - Open browser console (F12)
   - Look for messages like: "Recorded: 2 + 4 = 6 (CORRECT) in 1500ms"

3. **Test Admin Dashboard**:
   - Visit: https://rewardmaths.com/admin.html
   - Should show performance data
   - Test filtering and CSV export

## üìä **What Data Will Be Collected:**

### **Every Question Attempt Records**:
- Username (Tom, Patrick, Eliza)
- Exact timestamp (date and time)
- Level number
- Question text ("2 + 4", "5 - 3", etc.)
- Correct answer
- User's actual answer
- Whether answer was correct
- Response time (to nearest 100ms if under 10 seconds)
- Session ID (groups 20 questions together)
- Question number within session (1-20)

### **Analysis Capabilities**:
- Track improvement over time
- Identify difficult question types
- Monitor response speed trends
- Compare performance across children
- Generate comprehensive reports
- Export data for external analysis

## üéØ **Expected Results After Setup:**

### **During Game Play**:
- Seamless performance tracking (invisible to users)
- Console logs showing data being recorded
- Automatic session management for 20-question sets

### **Admin Dashboard Features**:
- Real-time performance statistics
- Filter by user, date range, level
- Summary cards showing accuracy, response times
- Detailed question-by-question data
- CSV export for external analysis
- Pagination for large datasets

### **Database Tables Created**:
- `question_attempts` - Every single question attempt
- `game_sessions` - 20-question session summaries
- `user_performance_summary` - High-level user statistics
- `performance_analysis` - View for easy data analysis
- `daily_performance` - Daily summary statistics

## üîç **Troubleshooting Guide:**

### **If Database Connection Fails**:
- Check credentials in `api/config.php`
- Verify database exists in cPanel
- Ensure user has proper privileges
- Check database name includes cPanel username prefix

### **If No Data Appears**:
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify API endpoints are accessible
- Test with `test_db.php`
- Check server error logs

### **If Performance Tracking Not Working**:
- Verify `performanceTracker.js` is loaded
- Check browser console for errors
- Test API endpoints directly
- Ensure database tables exist

## üìù **Quick Setup Checklist:**
- [ ] Create MySQL database in Bluehost cPanel
- [ ] Create database user with strong password
- [ ] Grant ALL PRIVILEGES to user
- [ ] Update credentials in `api/config.php`
- [ ] Run `database_setup.sql` in phpMyAdmin
- [ ] Test connection with `test_db.php`
- [ ] Play game and verify console logs
- [ ] Check admin dashboard at `admin.html`
- [ ] Test CSV export functionality

**Total estimated setup time: ~12 minutes**

## üöÄ **Ready to Go:**

Once these steps are completed, the system will immediately start collecting comprehensive performance data on every question attempt. This will provide valuable insights into each child's learning patterns, response times, and areas where they might need additional support.

The data will be perfect for future analysis to help improve the children's mathematical learning experience!
