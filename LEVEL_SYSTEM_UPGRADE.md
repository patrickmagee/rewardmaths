# Level System Upgrade - 20 Question Implementation

## Overview
Successfully upgraded the Reward Maths Game from a 10-question system to a sophisticated 20-question level progression system with advanced rules.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Core Configuration Updates
- **File**: `js/config.js`
- **Change**: Updated `QUESTIONS_PER_LEVEL` from 10 to 20
- **Impact**: All game logic now operates on 20 questions per level

### 2. New Level Rules System
- **File**: `js/level_rules.js` (NEW)
- **Purpose**: Clean separation of level progression logic
- **Features**:
  - Configurable thresholds and streak requirements
  - Comprehensive streak tracking (high score and low score)
  - Level change history recording
  - Modular design for easy maintenance

### 3. Level Progression Rules
The new system implements sophisticated progression rules:

#### Level Up Conditions:
- **Perfect Score (20/20)**: Automatic level up
- **High Score (19/20)**: Level up after 3 consecutive occurrences
- **Medium Score (15-18)**: Stay at current level, reset all streaks

#### Level Down Conditions:
- **Very Low Score (< 12)**: Immediate level down
- **Low Score (< 15)**: Level down after 2 consecutive occurrences

### 4. Game Logic Overhaul
- **File**: `js/game.js`
- **Major Changes**:
  - Complete rewrite to support 20-question sessions
  - Integration with new level rules system
  - Session tracking for all 20 questions
  - Enhanced progress display with correct answer count
  - Streak information display
  - Continues through all 20 questions regardless of wrong answers

### 5. Enhanced Progress Tracking
- **Progress Bar**: Now shows "X/20 (Y correct)" format
- **Streak Display**: Shows current high/low score streaks when active
- **Session Tracking**: Records all questions and answers in current session
- **Level History**: Maintains history of level changes with reasons

### 6. Comprehensive Testing
- **File**: `test_level_rules.html` (NEW)
- **Features**:
  - 13 unit tests covering all progression rules
  - Scenario tests with realistic usage patterns
  - Storage and streak tracking verification
  - All tests passing (13/13)

## Test Results Summary

### Unit Tests (13/13 Passed)
✅ Perfect score auto level up  
✅ Very low score immediate level down  
✅ High score streak progression (3x requirement)  
✅ Low score streak progression (2x requirement)

- ✅ New questions generating properly
- ✅ All new features functional

## For Future AI Agents

### Understanding the Level System
This implementation uses a sophisticated progression system that evaluates performance over complete 20-question sessions. Key concepts:

1. **Session-Based Evaluation**: Level changes only occur after completing all 20 questions
2. **Streak Tracking**: High score (19/20) and low score (<15) streaks are tracked across sessions
3. **Multiple Progression Paths**: Different rules for different performance levels
4. **Persistent Storage**: All streak data and level history stored in localStorage

### Code Architecture
```
js/level_rules.js
├── LEVEL_RULES (configuration constants)
├── LevelRulesManager (main class)
│   ├── evaluateLevelProgression() - Core logic
│   ├── Streak management methods
│   └── History tracking methods
```

### Key Methods for Future Modifications

#### `evaluateLevelProgression(username, currentLevel, score)`
- **Purpose**: Main evaluation function called after each 20-question session
- **Returns**: Object with newLevel, levelChanged, reason, streakInfo
- **Modify this**: To change progression logic or add new rules

#### Streak Management Methods
- `incrementHighScoreStreak(username)` - Tracks 19/20 streaks
- `incrementLowScoreStreak(username)` - Tracks <15 streaks  
- `resetStreaks(username)` - Clears all streaks (called on level change or medium scores)

#### Storage Methods
- `recordLevelChange()` - Logs level changes with timestamps and reasons
- `getLevelHistory()` - Retrieves user's level change history
- `getStreakInfo()` - Gets current streak status for display

### Testing Strategy
The test suite (`test_level_rules.html`) covers:

1. **Unit Tests**: Each progression rule individually
2. **Scenario Tests**: Realistic user behavior patterns
3. **Storage Tests**: Streak tracking and persistence
4. **Edge Cases**: Boundary conditions and error handling

### Common Modification Patterns

#### Adding New Progression Rules
```javascript
// In evaluateLevelProgression method
if (score >= NEW_THRESHOLD) {
    // Handle new rule
    result.newLevel = Math.min(currentLevel + 1, 100);
    result.levelChanged = true;
    result.reason = 'New rule triggered';
    return result;
}
```

#### Modifying Streak Requirements
```javascript
// In LEVEL_RULES configuration
HIGH_SCORE_STREAK_REQUIRED: 3,  // Change this number
LOW_SCORE_STREAK_REQUIRED: 2,   // Change this number
```

#### Adding New Score Thresholds
```javascript
// In LEVEL_RULES configuration
PERFECT_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 20,     // 20/20
HIGH_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 19,        // 19/20
MEDIUM_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 15,      // 15/20 (new)
LOW_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 15,         // <15
VERY_LOW_SCORE_THRESHOLD: 12,    // <12
```

### Integration Points

#### Game.js Integration
- `handleLevelCompletion()` calls `evaluateLevelProgression()`
- `showProgressionFeedback()` displays results to user
- `updateStreakDisplay()` shows current streak status

#### UI Integration
- Progress bar shows "X/20 (Y correct)" format
- Streak information displayed when active
- Level change animations and messages

### Debugging and Monitoring

#### Console Commands for Testing
```javascript
// Check current streaks
game.levelRulesManager.getStreakInfo('Tom')

// View level history  
game.levelRulesManager.getLevelHistory('Tom')

// Simulate level evaluation
game.levelRulesManager.evaluateLevelProgression('Tom', 10, 19)

// Reset streaks for testing
game.levelRulesManager.resetStreaks('Tom')
```

#### Common Issues and Solutions
1. **Streaks not resetting**: Check if `resetStreaks()` is called on level changes
2. **Wrong progression**: Verify score thresholds in `LEVEL_RULES`
3. **Storage issues**: Check localStorage keys and JSON parsing
4. **UI not updating**: Ensure `updateStreakDisplay()` is called after changes

### Performance Considerations
- Streak data is minimal (just counters)
- Level history is capped at 50 entries per user
- All operations are synchronous (no async complexity)
- localStorage operations are atomic

### Future Enhancement Ideas
1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Adjust requirements based on user performance
2. **Streak Bonuses**: Reward long streaks with extra points
3. **Performance Analytics**: Track detailed statistics
4. **Difficulty Scaling**: Adjust question difficulty based on streaks
5. **Achievement System**: Unlock rewards for specific streak patterns

### Testing Checklist for Modifications
- [ ] Run unit tests (`test_level_rules.html`)
- [ ] Test scenario patterns
- [ ] Verify streak tracking accuracy
- [ ] Check localStorage persistence
- [ ] Test UI updates and displays
- [ ] Verify level change messages
- [ ] Test edge cases (level 1, level 100)
- [ ] Check cross-session persistence

## Next Steps
